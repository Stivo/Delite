Delite scripts
==============

This set of scripts is designed to simplify playing with Delite. The bundle consists of four scripts per each family of operating systems: delitecfg/delitecfg.bat, delitec/delitec, delites/delites.bat and delite/delite.bat. There are also several auxiliary files, though we won't talk about them here.

Scripts require: sh interpreter when on Unix (not bash, since shell scripts in this package are really simple), batch interpreter when on Windows, java 1.6 or higher at system's PATH, and any scala interpreter at system's PATH to run delitecfg (we've tested the scripts with 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.1 - both worked finely). Scripts also rely on sbt (to inspect project metadata), though sbt is bundled along with the scripts, i.e. this dependency produces no additional requirements.

Scripts work correctly even if input filenames contain whitespaces. However they will fail if the path to Delite's home directory contains whitespaces (on Linux the runtime has a problem compiling code generated during staging, on Windows virtualized scala interpreter has troubles with understanding quoted -Ddelite.home.dir parameter).

How to use
==========

Scripts assume that you have already built both LMS and Delite (i.e. successfully run "sbt publish-local" for the prior and "sbt compile" for the latter). If you haven't done that already, use instructions from <a href="http://stanford-ppl.github.com/Delite/getting_started.html">"Getting started"</a> at Delite's homepage.

All Delite applications have three phases: compiling (Scala), staging (DSL compilation), and executing (runtime). The first step, running the scala compiler, checks your application for syntactic and type correctness. Staging is where the main compilation happens: the DSL builds an IR of the program, optimizes it, and generates an execution graph along with code for multiple targets (e.g. Scala and CUDA). Finally, the Delite runtime reads in the execution graph and generated kernels and executes the application.

1) delitecfg/delitecfg.bat. These scripts ask you for the home directory of Delite and infer everything else on their own. Generated configuration is saved to your home directory (~/.delitecfg on Unix, %USERPROFILE%\\.delitecfg.bat on Windows). The scripts do not take any command-line arguments, so the invocation is as simple as running <i>delitecfg</i>.

2) delitec/delitec.bat. (First phase) These scripts compile the app with scala-virtualized using settings generated by delitecfg. The invocation looks as follows: <i>delitec [&lt;compiler options&gt;] &lt;paths to Scala files that constitute the app&gt;</i>. You can find more information about the "compiler options" argument at <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/tools/scalac.html">scalac man page</a>.

3) delites/delites.bat. (Second phase) These scripts stage the app with scala-virtualized using settings generated by delitecfg. The invocation looks as follows: <i>delites [&lt;scala options&gt;] [&lt;framework configuration options&gt;] &lt;name of the runner class&gt;</i>. You can find more information about scala options at <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/tools/scala.html">scala man page</a>. You can also customize <a href="https://github.com/TiarkRompf/virtualization-lms-core/blob/delite-develop/src/internal/Config.scala">the configuration of LMS Framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stanford-ppl/Delite/blob/develop/framework/src/ppl/delite/framework/Config.scala">the configuration of Delite Framework</a>. To do that, provide command-line arguments in -D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt; format. For example, to dump the IR of the code being staged, run: delites -Dlms.verbosity=2 &lt;name of the runner class&gt;.

4) delite/delite.bat. (Third phase) These scripts invoke Delite runtime with user-provided DEG file and optional parameters. The invocation looks as follows: <i>delite [&lt;java options&gt;] [&lt;runtime configuration options&gt;] &lt;path to DEG file&gt; [&lt;application options&gt;]</i>. You can find more information about java options at <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html">java man page</a>. You can also customize <a href="https://github.com/stanford-ppl/Delite/blob/develop/runtime/src/ppl/delite/runtime/Config.scala">the configuration of Delite Runtime</a>. To do that, provide command-line arguments in -D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt; format. For example, to dump the sources generated during this phase, run: delite -Ddelite.debug.print.sources=true &lt;path to DEG file&gt;.

A hands-on example
================

1) Go to any directory (you may create a new one, or use an existing one) and create a file called HelloWorld.scala with the following content:
<pre><code lang="scala">import ppl.dsl.optiml._

object HelloWorldRunner extends OptiMLApplicationRunner with HelloWorld 

trait HelloWorld extends OptiMLApplication { 
  def main() = println("hello world")
}
</code></pre>

2) Run <i>delitecfg</i>. If it asks for Delite's home directory, provide the directory that you've cloned Delite sources into (the one with delite.properties). Here's an example of output:
<pre><code>xeno_by@xeno-main:~/Projects/Delite/HelloWorld$ delitecfg
Detecting the location of Delite...
Delite's home directory: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/

Detecting the location of scala virtualized...
Scala virtualized home: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/scala-virtualized/build/pack

Detecting the location of scala vanilla...
Scala vanilla home: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/runtime/project/boot/scala-2.8.1

Detecting the location of LMS...
LMS's main compile path: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/framework/lib_managed/scala_2.9.x-virtualized-SNAPSHOT/compile/virtualization-lms-core_2.9.x-virtualized-SNAPSHOT-0.1.jar

Detecting the location of Framework...
Framework's main compile path: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/framework/target/scala_2.9.x-virtualized-SNAPSHOT/classes

Detecting the location of OptiML...
OptiML's main compile path: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/dsls/optiml/target/scala_2.9.x-virtualized-SNAPSHOT/classes

Detecting the location of Runtime...
Runtime's main compile path: /home/xeno_by/Projects/Delite/Delite/runtime/target/scala_2.8.1/classes
</code></pre>

3) Run <i>delitec HelloWorld.scala</i>. This will perform initial compilation and prepare the test application for OptiML staging. Here's an example of output (as you see, nothing gets printed, but that's normal - if there were any errors, we'd see error messages):
<pre><code>xeno_by@xeno-main:~/Projects/Delite/HelloWorld$ delitec HelloWorld.scala 
</code></pre>

4) Run <i>delites HelloWorldRunner</i>. This will invoke virtualized scala and launch staging that will expand virtualized code written in OptiML DSL into a number of scala source files (for more information, peek into the "generated" directory next to HelloWorld.scala). Staging will also produce a DEG file ("out.deg" by default) that contains an execution graph of the expanded program.  Here's an example of output:
<pre><code>xeno_by@xeno-main:~/Projects/Delite/HelloWorld$ delites HelloWorldRunner
Delite Application Being Staged:[HelloWorldRunner$]
******Generating the program******
</code></pre>

5) Finally, run <i>delite out.deg</i>. This command fires up a JVM to actually execute staged code.  Here's an example of output:
<pre><code>xeno_by@xeno-main:~/Projects/Delite/HelloWorld$ delites HelloWorldRunner
Delite Application Being Staged:[HelloWorldRunner$]
******Generating the program******
xeno_by@xeno-main:~/Projects/Delite/HelloWorld$ delite out.deg
Delite Runtime executing with the following arguments:
out.deg
Delite Runtime executing with 1 CPU thread(s) and 0 GPU(s)
Beginning Execution Run 1
hello world
[METRICS]: Latest time for component all: 0.001000s
</code></pre>
