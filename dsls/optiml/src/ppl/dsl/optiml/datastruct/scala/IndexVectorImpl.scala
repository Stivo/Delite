/* IndexVector is an IntVector whose elements represent indices (e.g., of another vector).
 * It is either backed by a discrete sequence of integers (e.g. 1,5,10) or a continouous RangeVector.
 *
 * IndexVectors can be used for scatter/gather operations.
 *
 * They also provide a vector construction operator { } that takes a function mapping an index to a value,
 * producing a new vector.
